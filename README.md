### German Tutorials on Tuts+
#### Ian Yates

Sorry about this Brazil, but in celebration of Germany’s outstanding victory in the WC 2014 quarter finals, here are a load of tutorials from across the Tuts+ network which we've translated into German.

Huge thanks go to our translators  Florian Fischer, Patrick Heller, Viktoriana Kostov, Ferdinand Vogler, Roland Dietz, Jonas Hauss, Robert Pfeifer and Jonas Döbertin   :)
